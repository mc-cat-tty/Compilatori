# Compilers
## Backend
This folder contains example LLVM IR code, optimizable by our passes.

These examples will always be aliged to my custom [LLVM backend source code](https://github.com/mc-cat-tty/llvm-17.0.6-compilers).

For a more readable version of optimzation passes refer to our [assignments repository](https://github.com/ent0n29/compilers-assignments).
